This directory is used to store the private key and certificate the server uses for SSL. 

Before the server can be run, you must ensure you have generated the key and certificate. This can be done by
```bash
bash ./make.sh
```

Ensure that the key and certificate are NOT uploaded onto the github repo. They are set to be ignored in the .gitignore file.
